# The Power of Virtual Reality: Investigating the Correlation Between Climate Change and Neonatal Health and Survival in Nicragua
## Abstract
Climate change is having extreme impacts on the Nicaraguan people which is limiting human development. Nicaragua is experiencing both high temperatures and droughts, but also flooding. Another issue in Nicaragua is neonatal health and survival. The effects of a changing environment could potentially have a negative impact on pregnant women and their children. The impact of climate change has been investigated but not as directly. By investigating the futures of children, the door for investigating the future of technology was opened. Virtual reality is our future. But, how can VR be used with data science and data visualization? D6 allows for data to be analyzed and visualized in VR. The software allows for up to six variables to be compared at once. How can this new software be utilized to illustrate the correlation of climate change and neonatal health in Nicaragua? The goal is for more people to understand the data and correlations. By making this data more accesable for people to understand, change is more likely to occur where it is needed.

## Introoduction
With climate change being a critical and concerning topic today, how will climate change affect the future generations? More specifically how would this affect a developing country such as Nicaragua?

By focusing the support on local ownership, political reconciliation, consensus decision-making, social and gender equity, an environmental and public health perspective, and sustainability, Blandon and all were able to observe a positive shift in poverty and health in the North-West region in Nicaragua. “During the last decade, the proportion of individuals living in poverty was reduced from 79 to 47%. Primary school enrolment increased from 70 to 98% after the start of the school breakfast program. Under-five mortality was around 50 per 1,000 live births in 1990 and again peaked after Hurricane Mitch and was approaching 20 per 1,000 in 2014.” 

Technology is around us every second of every day. It is also constantly updating and improving. Virtual reality is an up and coming hot-topic in the tech world. With gaming taking a huge interest in virtual reality, many companies and research groups are seeing other benefits to virtual reality. One company, D6, wants to show how virtual reality can take data visualization to the next level. Virtual reality allows users to interact with the data. It also allows for the user to add more than two dimensions to the visualization. Adding more dimensions allows for more variables to be compared and analyzed. 

The climate and health data was both averaged for the decades of 1990, 2000, and 2010. The data does not just focus on Nicaragua due to a lack of data on lower administrative levels. The countries included are all central American countries, Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama, and the U.S. and Mexico. 

## Climate Change Factors
The climate data I chose to use was average CO2 metric tons per capita,	average renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption), average % of greenhouse gas emmisions change from 1990,	average arable land (% of land coverage),	average % of population exposed to toxic air polution, average CO2 damage (% of GNI), average net forest depletion (% of GNI),	average mineral depletion (% of GNI),	average particulate emmisions damage (% of GNI), and climate change risk index. I only used average CO2 damage (% of GNI), average % of population exposed to toxic air polution, and average particulate emmisions damage (% of GNI) when using the D6 software. Out of the data I found, these factors appeared to be the best to use. I will explain the three variables I used in D6 later.

When looking at the cimate data that I collected, I felt as if CO2 per capita left the U.S. and Mexico out as outliers. Both countries had data that were dramatically larger than the data for the Central American countries. I also felt as if keeping the unit of measurement the same between the climate factors. So, I stuck more with the data that was in the terms of the percent of GNI. The damage percent of the GNI is the cost of damage to a countries income. The net forest depletion (% of GNI), according to Index Mundi, is "the product of unit resource rents and the excess of roundwood harvest over natural growth." A high percentage means there is a higher destruction of forest. The mineral depletion is the same thing but for natural mineral resources instead.

The Climate Risk Index is a very interesting and important calculation. This risk index looks at the damage caused by extreme weather. It compares fatalities, fatalities per 1,000 people, Losses in US$ million (PPP), and Losses per unit GDP. Acording to Germanwatch, "each country's index score has been derived from a country's average ranking in all four indicating categories, according to the following weighting: death toll, 1/6; deaths per 100 000 inhabitants, 1/3; absolute losses in PPP, 1/6; losses per GDP unit, 1/3." Climate change is less seen in the day to day changes in temperature, rain fall, etc. but rather in the incidences of extree weather. The Climate Risk Index focuses on the extreme wether conditions, which is a better representation of climate change. This data were hard to illustrate using D6 due to range of ranking and when the ranks were given.

## Correlation between Climate Change and Neonatal Survival

## Challenges
Throughout the process of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data, I ran into many challenges.
### Data Collection
My goal was to collect data secific to the regions in Nicaragua. However, I could not find enough data on the specific departments in Nicaragua. 

## Conclusion
