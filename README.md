# The Power of Virtual Reality: Investigating the Correlation Between Climate Change and Neonatal Health and Survival in Nicragua
## Abstract
Climate change is having extreme impacts on the Nicaraguan people which is limiting human development. Nicaragua is experiencing both high temperatures and droughts, but also flooding. Another issue in Nicaragua is neonatal health and survival. The effects of a changing environment could potentially have a negative impact on pregnant women and their children. The impact of climate change has been investigated but not as directly. By investigating the futures of children, the door for investigating the future of technology was opened. Virtual reality is our future. But, how can VR be used with data science and data visualization? D6 allows for data to be analyzed and visualized in VR. The software allows for up to six variables to be compared at once. How can this new software be utilized to illustrate the correlation of climate change and neonatal health in Nicaragua? The goal is for more people to understand the data and correlations. By making this data more accesable for people to understand, change is more likely to occur where it is needed.

## Introoduction
With climate change being a critical and concerning topic today, how will climate change affect the future generations? More specifically how would this affect a developing country such as Nicaragua?

By focusing the support on local ownership, political reconciliation, consensus decision-making, social and gender equity, an environmental and public health perspective, and sustainability, Blandon and all were able to observe a positive shift in poverty and health in the North-West region in Nicaragua. “During the last decade, the proportion of individuals living in poverty was reduced from 79 to 47%. Primary school enrolment increased from 70 to 98% after the start of the school breakfast program. Under-five mortality was around 50 per 1,000 live births in 1990 and again peaked after Hurricane Mitch and was approaching 20 per 1,000 in 2014.” 

Technology is around us every second of every day. It is also constantly updating and improving. Virtual reality is an up and coming hot-topic in the tech world. With gaming taking a huge interest in virtual reality, many companies and research groups are seeing other benefits to virtual reality. One company, D6, wants to show how virtual reality can take data visualization to the next level. Virtual reality allows users to interact with the data. It also allows for the user to add more than two dimensions to the visualization. Adding more dimensions allows for more variables to be compared and analyzed.
